				<h3>Who developed the "first computer program"?</h3>
				
				<p>Allan G. Bromley, in the 1990 article <i>Difference and Analytical Engines</i>, wrote,</p>
	
					<blockquote><p>All but one of the programs cited in her notes had been prepared by Babbage from three to seven years earlier. The exception was <strong>prepared by Babbage for her</strong>, although she did detect a 'bug' in it. Not only is there no evidence that Ada ever prepared a program for the Analytical Engine, but her correspondence with Babbage shows that she did not have the knowledge to do so.</p>

				<h5>What are the primary sources?</h5>
				
				<p>Babbage wrote in his Autobiography in 1864 ,</p>
	
					<blockquote><p>I then suggested that she add some notes to Menabrea's memoir, an idea which was immediately adopted. We discussed together the various illustrations that might be introduced; I suggested several but the selection was entirely her own. So also was the algebraic working out of the different problems, except, indeed, that relating to the <mark>numbers of Bernoulli</mark>, which <strong>I had offered to do</strong> to save Lady Lovelace the trouble. This she sent back to me for an amendment, having detected a grave mistake which I had made in the process.</p>

				<p><u>My Interpretation</u>: <strong>Babbage states, that he developed the Bernoulli numbers program</strong> published in Ada Lovelace's Note G in 1843.</p>
